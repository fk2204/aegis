"""Severity mapping for each Track B factor + the band-from-severities
combinator.

Each factor (``true_revenue``, ``nsf``, ``mca_positions``, ...) has a
threshold table that maps its measured value to a ``SignalSeverity``.
The band is the worst severity observed; the underwriter reads the
reasons list to see WHY.

Thresholds are conservative and explainable. The numbers are tuned
to the operator's underwriting research — not derived from a black-box
optimisation. Each threshold change is a deliberate code edit (with
the rationale in the diff), never a hidden tuning to clear a specific
deal (CLAUDE.md "no track-tuning to pass a specific merchant" rule).
