# AEGIS — Remaining work

**Snapshot taken:** 2026-06-11 (post-session closure pass: 2026-06-10
session work + the "Add funder via Claude Code" wrapper. Seven items
moved from open to ✅ CLOSED with resolving commits inline. See the
"2026-06-10 closure log" at the head of each section for what shipped).
**Purpose:** durable list of what's queued, parked, or systemic. So nothing's
lost between sessions.

Cross-references:
- `CLAUDE.md` — guardrails (binding rules learned from the work below)
- `docs/CLOSE_AUTOMATION_SPEC.md` — Option-A locked automation spec
- `docs/SCORING_REDESIGN_CONTINUATION.md` — 3-track scoring redesign
- `docs/audit-confirmed-bugs.md` — confirmed bugs awaiting decision-boundary fixes

## Immediate / queued builds

Ready to scope or already specced.

### "Add funder via Claude Code" ✅ CLOSED 2026-06-11
Shipped as `scripts/add_funder.py`. Two subcommands:

```
python scripts/add_funder.py extract <file>... [--output PATH]
python scripts/add_funder.py save --from PATH [--dry-run]
```

`extract` reads PDF/PNG bytes, routes through the existing
`extract_funder_guidelines` / `extract_funder_guidelines_from_image` /
`merge_extractions` engine, prints the merged `FunderGuidelineExtraction`
as JSON to stdout (or `--output`) plus a human-readable summary with
low-confidence fields (<60) to stderr. `save` re-reads the (possibly
edited) preview and calls `FunderRepository.upsert`. Two-phase by
design so Claude Code can show fields in chat between extract and
save — CLAUDE.md "extraction assists, never replaces judgment" is
enforced by the workflow, not the CLI. `--dry-run` validates round-trip
without writing.

Pure-function core + DI-injected IO (LLM client, repo, file readers)
so the 26-test suite at `tests/scripts/test_add_funder.py` runs
against `InMemoryFunderRepository` + a stub LLM. No new write path,
no new prompt.

Pre-existing gap noted: neither this wrapper NOR the
`/ui/funders/import/save` route writes an audit row on funder upsert
(repo.upsert is bare). If audit becomes required, the fix lands in
the repository layer so both call sites cover.

### Funder-extraction prompt — third rule ✅ CLOSED 2026-06-10 (`b07bfe1`)
Rule 11 added as syntactic subject-test on top of Rule 9's semantic
enumeration: inspect the grammatical subject of each clause before
deciding the bucket. If subject is the agent / ISO / broker /
referring party / "you", the obligation is agent-side regardless of
topic — routes to `notes_residual`. Reinforces default-to-residual
posture. 95 existing funder tests still pass; prompt-only change.

Historical context preserved: Shor's ISO retest still leaked CA/VA
agent-compliance clauses into `conditional_requirements` at confidence
72 after the first prompt-tighten, motivating Rule 11.

### `/uploads/from-close` route — xfail debt ✅ CLOSED 2026-06-10 (`201bb2d`)
Route now calls `list_lead_attachments(body.close_lead_id)` before
`download_attachment(body.attachment_id)` inside the existing try
block. Cache-miss after a successful list call mapped to 404
(semantically the attachment doesn't belong to this lead). All 5
previously-xfailed tests in `tests/api/test_uploads_from_close.py`
removed from xfail and passing. Mock transport refactored to
dispatch by URL path.

## Fraud-review list (human underwriting, NOT parser-salvage)

These are merchants AEGIS correctly gated to `manual_review` because the
parser flagged real integrity-signature concerns. They need a human
underwriter to look at the actual PDFs — not a parser fix, not a
threshold tweak.

| Merchant | Signature | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **VU Development 7722** (`5cf4479d…`) | Running-balance drift $5 / $11 / $55 across 3 of 4 months | Correctly gated by parser. Awaiting human review. |
| **A&R KM LLC** (`a522a8fb…`) | iText 2.1.7 editor metadata + reconciliation drift across 4 of 4 Lili Monthly Statements (period drift $15-$500, withdrawal-total drift $220-$690) | Correctly gated by parser. Awaiting human review. |

**Pattern watch:** two real merchants with the running-balance-drift
signature in the same week. If a third independent merchant arrives
with the same pattern, that suggests a bad source / channel /
referral relationship — worth a separate look at submission origin.

These are the real-world test cases for the integrity track of the
3-track scoring redesign — they prove the parser's tampering
detection works on real merchant data without any tuning.

## Parked — deliberate decisions for a fresh, focused session

Not ready to ship; need dedicated thinking, not opportunistic patching.

### 3-track scoring redesign — THE multi-week build
- **Spec:** `docs/SCORING_REDESIGN_CONTINUATION.md` (canonical) and
  `docs/AEGIS_SCORING_REDESIGN.md` (background).
- **Decided (Q1):** band → action mapping is
  `low = auto-forward`,
  `moderate/elevated = review-neutral`,
  `high = review-decline-default`.
- **Open (Q2):** integrity states —
  `fail = strong_metadata`,
  `review = medium_corroborated`,
  `clean = none`,
  AND running-balance-drift placement: drift alone = review;
  drift + editor metadata = fail.
  **VU 7722 and A&R KM are the test cases** — drift-alone vs
  drift+editor decides which way they'd auto-route.
- **Open (Q4):** own-account-unconfirmed — surface the gap, do NOT
  infer ownership.
- This subsumes A.2 (the 65/70 threshold) and the A.1 EOF gate as
  policy implementations within the new tracks.

### Step 2 of 3-track redesign — `fraud_score` retirement + A+B+C live cutover
- **Status:** A/B/C live ADDITIVE on the dossier (commit `5d53d5d`,
  verified VU + A&R KM 2026-06-05). The existing `score_deal` /
  `fraud_score` path still controls every production decision. Step 2
  retires `fraud_score` and flips A/B/C live. **NOT authorized** —
  gated on the conditions below.
- **Diagnostics in place:**
  - `scripts/shadow_comparison_a_b_c_vs_fraud_score.py` (commit `973d7fd`).
    Read-only sweep — every merchant in the corpus, LIVE decision vs
    new A/B/C, categorised per disagreement bucket. Re-run periodically;
    treat exit code 3 (any `old-caught-something-new-misses` row) as a STOP.
  - `scripts/track_a_historical_lookback.py` (commit `618bdea`, Wave 4.1).
    Walks every document whose `fraud_score >= HARD_DECLINE_THRESHOLD`
    and runs `compute_integrity_verdict` on persisted Track A signals.
    Exit code 3 = at least one miss row (REGRESSION — operator triage
    required). Read-only; box-run, not laptop-run.
  - `docs/STEP_2_CUTOVER_REVIEW.md` (commit `2fc11ff`, Wave 4.3). The
    operator's triage workspace — three honest disagreement categories
    (`genuine-regression`, `detector-gap`, `corpus-shape-artifact`),
    row template, authorisation log. Gates the env-var flip on zero
    un-reviewed open rows.
- **Cutover gating conditions — ALL required, in order:**
  1. **Corpus growth.** The 2026-06-06 baseline is N=1 for Track B/C
     comparison (only VU had classified transactions; A&R KM had docs
     but the `manual_review` path persisted no analyses). A cutover
     decision on N=1 is not a population claim, it is a case
     observation. Need significantly more deals through both systems
     before "no regressions" means anything.
  2. **Track A historical lookback.** ✅ Script shipped 2026-06-10.
     Awaits operator-run against prod corpus + miss-row triage via
     `STEP_2_CUTOVER_REVIEW.md`.
  3. **Regression review.** Every
     `old-caught-something-new-misses` row across the accumulated
     re-runs gets per-merchant operator triage — categorise (genuine
     regression vs detector gap vs corpus-shape artifact) BEFORE
     flipping. Zero rows is not the bar; **reviewed rows** is the
     bar.
  4. **Deliberate flip.** When the gating conditions are met, the
     flip is an env var change (mirrors the tampering-rule pattern:
     shadow → live by config, not code deploy). The PR title says
     "retire fraud_score" — small, explicit, reversible.
- **What this is NOT:** a small-N green-light. The 2026-06-06 sweep
  landed VU=agreement and A&R KM=new-is-better; both were the
  predicted-correct categorizations and prove the comparison
  machinery works. They do not prove the new system is safe to take
  over decisions on merchants not yet seen. Re-running the script
  monthly (or whenever ≥5 new merchants flow through) keeps the
  baseline current; a clean exit 0 on a small corpus does not
  authorize cutover on its own.

### A.1 + A.2 decline-boundary policy ✅ CLOSED 2026-06-10
- **A.2** — `4c1c743` aliased `FRAUD_SCORE_HARD_DECLINE` to
  `HARD_DECLINE_THRESHOLD = 65`; regression test pins equality at the
  boundary. `fcecdb2` refreshed 6 stale "≥ 70" references in
  config / env-var docs / flag glossary / scorer docstring.
- **A.1** — box-side env var `AEGIS_EOF_THRESHOLD=2` set in
  `/etc/aegis/aegis.env` on 2026-06-10; aligns scorer with the
  pipeline's R4.6 narrative (EOFs=2 is normal for legit online-banking
  exports, not a hard decline).
- Both items documented in `docs/audit-confirmed-bugs.md` header as
  ✅ CLOSED with their resolving commits.

### NY broker-compensation disclosure guard ✅ CLOSED 2026-06-10 (`6f595a4`)
`match_funder` now calls `validate_broker_compensation_disclosure`
next to the existing `excluded_states` check. NY merchant paired with
a funder whose `aegis_compensation_disclosure_text` is empty surfaces
as a hard-fail on the match grid with reason
`broker_compensation_text_missing`. Catches the base
`BrokerCompensationDisclosureMissing` so future states added to
`_STATE_RULES` auto-apply without further edits. Three regression
tests (NY-empty / NY-present / CA-empty pass-through) in
`tests/funders/test_match_regression.py`. 456 funder + compliance
tests still green.

### Tampering rule shadow → live flip
- **Status:** shadow mode active. Audit-log action
  `tampering_would_decline` fires when the rule would have declined,
  but no actual decline is emitted.
- **Watch:** real fires in audit_log to see whether the rule's
  precision holds on live merchants (A&R KM and VU 7722 would have
  fired; review for false positives elsewhere).
- ✅ **Parse-time persistence gap CLOSED 2026-06-10 (`14c9671`):**
  `documents.all_flags` now carries the tampering verdict from
  parse time —
  `[SHADOW] bank_statement_tampering_confirmed:<branch>` while in
  shadow, `[META] bank_statement_tampering_confirmed:<branch>` after
  the flip. Visible on the dossier; close-queue ignores SHADOW prefix
  by design. Not a decision-boundary change — the score-time decline
  gate still reads `deal.tampering_confirmed`.
- **Flip mechanism:** env var change, no code deploy.
- **Do NOT flip** until shadow audit rows reviewed against known
  good + known bad cases.

## Infra / systemic

Things that gate future work or limit how parallel we can be safely.

### Worktree isolation is broken
- **Observed:** 2026-06-05 — agents fell back to operating on main
  worktree repeatedly during the parallel build wave.
- **Why parallel was safe tonight:** files were strictly disjoint at
  the WRITE level (Track 1 wrote funder code + llm.py + funder
  templates; Track 2 wrote close client + close tests). Disjoint
  files were the actual protection, not the worktree.
- **Implication:** any future parallel batch that edits the SAME
  existing files (e.g. both touching `router.py` for unrelated UI
  work) is unsafe until isolation is fixed.
- **Fix:** investigate why worktree isolation fell back to main,
  ship a reproducible isolation mode. Gates future parallel-write
  work on shared files.

### `router.py` is monolithic
- **Current state:** ~2,800 lines, all `/ui/*` routes plus several
  `/api/*` ones, plus shared helpers.
- **Cost tonight:** parallel UI work (funder add-form + merchant
  add-form) was only file-disjoint because Agent B was reduced to
  a template-only change. If both had needed router edits, the
  parallel wave would have been a forced sequential.
- **Fix:** split per-domain into `src/aegis/web/routers/funders.py`,
  `merchants.py`, `close.py`, `dossier.py`, etc. Each importable as
  a FastAPI sub-router.
- **Status:** backlog; not blocking, but it would make parallel
  UI work routinely safe.

### Mapper test coverage shipped tonight — applies to future mappers too
- 117 structural-coverage tests landed for the
  storage / deals / funders / compliance mappers. Caught three real
  prod bugs (`_row_to_document` dropped chunk-B columns;
  `_row_to_deal` missing None-guard on state; `_doc_row_from_db`
  duplicated logic from `_row_to_document`).
- **Principle:** the in-memory backend is NOT a substitute for
  real-mapper coverage. Any new repository that ships a `_row_to_*`
  function must ship structural-coverage tests with it. See
  CLAUDE.md "external-integration test discipline" — same rule, same
  reason, same failure mode.

## 2026-06-10 closure log

What shipped in this session (15 commits, all on origin/main through
`20f60ec`). Closures referenced above; this is the consolidated index:

- **A.2 + audit closure** — `4c1c743` aligned `FRAUD_SCORE_HARD_DECLINE`
  → 65; `fcecdb2` refreshed 6 stale "≥ 70" references; `1633d4a`
  marked A.1/A.2/A.3 ✅ CLOSED in `docs/audit-confirmed-bugs.md`.
- **A.1** — box-side `AEGIS_EOF_THRESHOLD=2` set in `/etc/aegis/aegis.env`.
- **Funder-extraction prompt Rule 11** — `b07bfe1` syntactic
  agent-duty subject-test ON TOP of Rule 9's semantic enumeration.
- **NY broker-comp guard wired** — `6f595a4` in `match_funder` (catches
  the base class, future states auto-apply).
- **`/uploads/from-close` URL-cache prime** — `201bb2d`; 5 xfails removed.
- **Tampering parse-time persistence** — `14c9671`
  `[SHADOW]/[META] bank_statement_tampering_confirmed:<branch>` on
  `documents.all_flags`.
- **Track A historical lookback script** — `618bdea` Wave 4.1, with
  injected DI Protocol for test isolation, 14 tests green.
- **Cutover-review workspace + industry normaliser** — `2fc11ff`
  Wave 4.3 (`docs/STEP_2_CUTOVER_REVIEW.md`) + 1.4
  (`scripts/normalise_funder_industries.py` in dry-run-default mode).
- **Manual back-fill cleanup** — `6682c30` (3 scripts removed),
  preceded by `60ce74d` operator-directed acceptance-set trim.
- **Close-queue stale-row tests** — `5f937d9` pinned 6h-pull / 1h-parse
  predicates (12 cases).
- **Security allow-list** — `93c04c2` github.com added under
  documentation-references (admin health page repo URL).
- **CF_API_TOKEN convention** — `f5ff460` added, then `20f60ec` reverted
  per operator direction (no CF-side automation planned; canonical
  health monitoring is the push-based `aegis-heartbeat-*` timers).

## Done + live previously (for reference, not action)

So the next session knows what's in.

- **Funder UI**
  - `/ui/funders/new` manual create form (Wave 1A)
  - `/ui/funders/import` accepts multi-file + image uploads, merges
    extractions, ignores screenshot chrome (Wave 2 commits b85d81d
    → 023a6cb)
  - Funder extraction prompt tightened (split agent-clauses from
    merchant gating, canonical lowercase-hyphenated industries) —
    Shor accuracy DANGER bucket 4→1 PNG / 2→1 ISO, KEPT
- **Funder seed:** Shor Capital live in prod (`c5f05242…`)
- **Merchant UI:** `+ Add manually` button now reaches the existing
  `/ui/merchants/new` form (Wave 1B)
- **JSON parser bug fix:** `_first_json_object` uses
  `json.JSONDecoder().raw_decode` — affects every Bedrock JSON
  consumer (commit 06b771e)
- **Close client rewire:** `list_lead_attachments` walks note +
  email activity endpoints; `download_attachment` rewrites
  `app.close.com` → `api.close.com`. CloseAttachment.id synthesized
  from `sha256(url)[:16]` (commits 0067453 + 7184257). **Proven
  end-to-end on A&R KM's real Close lead** — pull (6 PDFs) → parse
  (5 docs reached terminal) → correctly gated.
- **`/ui/close-queue`** — pipeline state for every Close-sourced
  merchant; gated-rows-get-review-not-retry; STALE badge on stuck
  rows; gating-reason detail surfaces flag categories ("editor
  metadata + reconciliation drift" for A&R KM, "reconciliation
  drift + pattern signal" for VU). Commits 35a2fa7 + d2e49f1.
- **Spec persisted:** `docs/CLOSE_AUTOMATION_SPEC.md` (Option-A
  locked)
- **Tampering shadow mode:** building
  `bank_statement_tampering_confirmed` flag — fires audit row but
  no decline (commits 2d91a36 + 875d08a)
- **Dashboard redesign + fraud-signal legibility** — earlier waves
- **3 mapper bug fixes** (H2 / A.3 / H1 class) — caught by the new
  117-test mapper coverage suite
